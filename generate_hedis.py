"""Build the HEDIS Quality Measures data model as `const HEDIS = {...}` for the ERD app.

This documents the star schema produced by demos/hedis-quality/hedis_pipeline.py, with
each entity colored by PROVENANCE via its `kind` (see the STYLE map in index.html):

  file      → ingested from HEDIS files with Auto Loader (green)
  datacloud → sourced from Salesforce Data Cloud, zero-copy (blue)
  measure   → computed HEDIS quality events / performance (purple)
  ref       → reference data (grey)

Output structure matches the other generators so buildTab() renders it.
